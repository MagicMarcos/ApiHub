## Contribution Guidelines

- If you're planning to implement a new feature I will recommend you to discuss with me before you start coding so you won't end up working on something that I don't want to implement. Create an Issue with proper name and content for discussion.
- If you need any help understanding the code you can reach out to me on twitter/[@aadarshatweets](https://twitter.com/aadarshatweets)

- For Contributing to this project or any project on GitHub
  1. Fork project.
  2. Create a branch with the name of feature that you're working on (e.g. `category-select`).
  3. Once you're done coding create a merge request from your new branch to my `main`.
